    </h3>
    <div class="content-small description">
      <p><i>Objective-C Succinctly</i> is the only book you need for getting started with Objective-Câ€”the primary language beneath all Mac, iPad, and iPhone apps. Written by Ryan Hodson, the author behind our popular <i>Knockout.js Succinctly</i> and <i>PDF Succinctly</i> titles, this e-book guides you from downloading Xcode, Apple's Objective-C IDE, to utilizing advanced features like blocks (similar to C#'s lambdas) and protocols. Along the way, you'll learn how the familiar aspects of object-oriented programming, such as interfaces, classes, methods, etc., are used in Objective-C, giving you the ability to leverage your existing knowledge with the tools presented in the book.
