    <div class="content-small description">
      <p><i>jQuery Succinctly</i> was written to express, in short-order, the concepts essential to intermediate
        and advanced jQuery development. Its purpose is to instill in you, the reader, practices that
        jQuery developers take as common knowledge. Each chapter contains concepts essential to
        becoming a seasoned jQuery developer.
      </p><p>
      This book is intended for two types of readers. The first is someone who has read introductory
      material on jQuery and is looking for the next logical step. The second type of reader is a
      JavaScript developer, already versed in another library, now trying to quickly learn jQuery. I crafted this book to be used as my own personal reference point
      for jQuery concepts. This is exactly the type of book I wish every JavaScript library had available.
