        ASP.NET MVC is a framework from Microsoft for building web apps. It follows the Model View Controller design pattern to keep the data, views, and logic clearly separated in apps, and encourages developers to follow good coding practices. The framework provides the Razor view engine for creating a consistent look and feel in your apps, and HTML helpers to provide an easy way to design your app without having to write all of the markup on your own. With <i>ASP.NET MVC Succinctly</i> by Nick Harrison, you will learn how to use these features and more, including how to integrate your app with jQuery, and how to use MVC scaffolding to automatically generate the more tedious portions of your code.
