        The Open Web Server Interface for .NET specification, or OWIN, defines a standard interface for web servers and .NET client applications to interact that frees your code from IIS and System.Web. With <i>OWIN Succinctly</i>, you will learn how to use Microsoft’s implementation of OWIN with different frameworks, how to write custom middleware to manage requests in the OWIN pipeline, and how to provide different forms of authentication to your web app. Now is the time to see what OWIN is all about—it has been a major influence on the development of ASP.NET v5, and will also be supported in it.
